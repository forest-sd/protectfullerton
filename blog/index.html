When residents attend council meetings, serve on commissions, participate in public comment periods, and vote in local elections, they create accountability mechanisms that no amount of formal oversight can replace. Engaged communities also generate better policy ideas, because residents understand the ground-level impacts of decisions in ways that officials and consultants cannot. The challenge is making participation accessible — meeting times, locations, childcare, language access, and digital tools all affect who can participate and who gets left out.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Understanding Your Local Budget: Where Your Tax Dollars Go</h3><p>The city budget is the single most important policy document your local government produces. It determines how much you pay in taxes and fees, what services you receive, and which neighborhoods get investment. Yet few residents ever read it. Fullerton's general fund budget allocates the largest share to public safety (police and fire), followed by public works, community development, and parks. Understanding these allocations helps you evaluate whether your priorities align with your government's spending decisions — and gives you concrete data for advocating changes during the annual budget process.</p></div></div></div></section>
